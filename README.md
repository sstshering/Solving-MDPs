# Solving-MDPs
To experiment with some of the basic algorithms for solving MDPs on a simple domain.  
In this project, we are using three search algorithms; Monte Calo, Value Iteration and Q-Learning.

Note: this code is implemented according to the standards of python3 version and would need some changes to run on other version.
